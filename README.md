# Discbro - My own version of Discord
This is Discbro, a chat app similar to Discord.
It has accounts, servers, channels, dms, and friends


## Why?
Because I want to

## How
Using the things we are learning to use at school

## Features
- Automatically sets up an empty database when none is present (automatic setup)
- Account system with encrypted passwords (no https tho yet so kinda useless)
- Real time messaging using websockets, with chunk loading system for performance and functionality
- Channels
- Friends, customizable themes,

## Future features
- Sending messages directly to each other instead of through server (faster, lighter load on server, but less secure)
- Voice chat?
- On larger channels, creating a web of clients that distribute the messages to increase efficiency and lower latency
- Servers and direct messages (and groups)
